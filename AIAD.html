							<p>Short Advertising Video has become an increasingly dominant form of advertisement on social media. However, making Short Advertising Video is a challenging task for micro and small businesses, since it requires professional skills and years of experience.</p>
							<p>In this study, we present a novel approach of Short Advertising Video generation assisted by robotic arms. We analyzed the professional composition and imaging of advertising videos, and transformed them into an automatic shooting process during the production of Short Advertising Video, assisted by a robotic arm. Practically, we applied our approach in two kinds of robotic arms and the results showed that robotic arm assist solution can highly enhance the efficiency and effect of making Short Advertising Video. In addition, our video generation approach can save time and money for novice users from micro and small business who has very limit resources and budget. And, we believe that our approach might overturn the existing production model of the Short Advertising Video propagated in the online business and social media.</p>
