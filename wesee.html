The delicate string manipulating rules and techniques behind Quanzhou Marionette Show the wisdom of folk traditional performing arts. Even today, with the rapid development of science and technology, this performing skill still has its advanced nature. We are inspired by it, borrowing and transforming marionette performance through new technologies in the new era, and paying homage to tradition with technology. Under the control of string board, the marionettes’ posture changes from the limbs to the whole body. It can achieve the artistic expression of the performance. Nowadays, many scientific puppets have never borrowed this structure,so that they cannot control the humanoid puppets that are difficult to perform. In order to let more people understand the intangible cultural heritage and spread and promote the intangible cultural heritage of Quanzhou Marionette Show among cross-cultural people, this paper combines the robotic arm with the performance, innovate its form, and realize the Quanzhou Marionette Show under the control of the robotic arm by simulating the puppeteer’s control of the marionette; At the same time, the audience’s understanding of this traditional art is changed through more rich and vivid interactions, thus shorting the distance between the audience and Quanzhou Marionettes Show. </p>
